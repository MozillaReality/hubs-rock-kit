# hubs-rock-kit

This repository contains some organic rock assets for building scenes in in [Spoke](https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke). In this repo, you will find the Blender files, as well as textures and the deployment script that is used to publish to Spoke.

The Hubs Rock Kit is one example of configurable pieces that can be used to create new meshes in Spoke. In the future, we plan to make it easy for 3D artists to create their own kits and publish them to Spoke using a similar format as this kit.

# Download

In order to download the source files for the kit you will need the [Github Desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/), or [Git-LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) if you are using the command line. Then clone the repository.
